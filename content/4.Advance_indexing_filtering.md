## Introduction to Advanced Indexing

When working with data, we often need to focus on specific elements that meet certain criteria. NumPy provides elegant and efficient ways to accomplish this through:

1. Boolean masking
2. The `np.where()` function
3. The `np.isin()` function

Let's explore each technique in detail.

## Boolean Masking: The Concept

Boolean masking is a fundamental technique in NumPy that allows us to filter arrays based on conditions. The process happens in two steps:

**Step 1: Create a Boolean Mask:**

* We apply a condition to an array
* This produces a new array of the same shape filled with `True` and `False` values
* Elements that satisfy our condition are marked as `True`
* Elements that don't satisfy our condition are marked as `False`

**Step 2: Apply the Mask:**

* We use this boolean array to index into our original array
* Only elements corresponding to `True` values are selected

Let's see this in action:

:::{demo}

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a sample array
data = np.array([1, 4, 2, 5, 3])
print("Original array:", data)

# Create a boolean mask for elements greater than 3
mask = data > 3
print("Boolean mask (data > 3):", mask)
# This produces: [False, True, False, True, False]

# Apply the mask to select elements
selected_data = data[mask]
print("Selected elements:", selected_data)
# This produces: [4, 5]
```

:::

Notice how elegant this approach is: the mask array has the exact same shape as our data array, with each position containing information about whether that element meets our criteria.

## Combining Multiple Conditions

We can combine multiple conditions using logical operators:

* `&` for logical AND
* `|` for logical OR
* `~` for logical NOT

:::{demo}

```python
# Creating a 2D array for demonstration
arr = np.array([[5, 10, 15], 
                [20, 25, 30],
                [35, 40, 45]])

# Elements greater than 20 AND less than 40
mask = (arr > 20) & (arr < 40)
print("Elements between 20 and 40:", arr[mask])
# This produces: [25 30 35]

# Elements less than 15 OR greater than 40
mask = (arr < 15) | (arr > 40)
print("Elements less than 15 or greater than 40:", arr[mask])
# This produces: [ 5 10 45]
```

:::

**Important:** When combining conditions, always use parentheses around each individual condition to ensure proper precedence.

## Using `np.where()`: Finding Positions

The `np.where()` function gives us even more capabilities. In its simplest form, it returns the indices where a condition is True:

:::{demo}

```python
# Create an array with a sequence
data = np.arange(0, 20, 3)  # [0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18]
print("Original array:", data)

# Find indices where elements are even
indices = np.where(data % 2 == 0)
print("Indices of even elements:", indices[0])
# This produces: [0, 2, 4, 6]

# Use these indices to get the actual values
even_elements = data[indices]
print("Even elements:", even_elements)
# This produces: [ 0,  6, 12, 18]
```

:::

The result of `np.where()` is a tuple of arrays, one for each dimension of the input array. Since we're working with a 1D array here, we access the first (and only) element of this tuple with `indices[0]`.

## Using `np.where()`: Conditional Assignment

The real power of `np.where()` comes from its three-argument form:

```python
np.where(condition, x, y)
```

This works like a vectorized if-else statement:

* Where the condition is `True`, take values from array `x`
* Where the condition is `False`, take values from array `y`

:::{demo}

```python
# Original array: [0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18]

# Replace odd numbers with zeros
result = np.where(data % 2 == 0, data, 0)
print("Even numbers preserved, odd numbers replaced with 0:", result)
# This produces: [ 0,  0,  6,  0, 12,  0, 18]

# Another example: create an array that shows whether each element is even or odd
labels = np.where(data % 2 == 0, "even", "odd")
print("Labels for each element:", labels)
# This produces: ['even' 'odd' 'even' 'odd' 'even' 'odd' 'even']
```

:::

This is much more concise and efficient than using loops or other conditional constructs.

## The `np.isin()` Function

The `np.isin()` function checks whether elements in one array are present in another array. It creates a boolean mask that we can use for filtering:

:::{demo}

```python
# Original array: [0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18]

# Check which elements are in a set of values
test_values = [0, 6, 15]
mask = np.isin(data, test_values)
print("Elements that are in test_values:", data[mask])
# This produces: [ 0,  6, 15]

# We can also use the ~ operator for negation
print("Elements that are NOT in test_values:", data[~mask])
# This produces: [ 3,  9, 12, 18]
```

:::

This is especially useful when we have a specific set of values we're interested in.

## Practical Applications

These techniques are foundational for data analysis tasks:

1. Data Cleaning: Filter out missing or invalid values

   ```python
   clean_data = data[~np.isnan(data)]  # Remove NaN values
   ```

2. Feature Selection: Extract data points that meet specific criteria

   ```python
   high_importance = data[data > threshold]
   ```

3. Conditional Transformations: Apply different operations to different elements

   ```python
   normalized = np.where(data > 0, data/data.max(), data/abs(data.min()))
   ```

## Performance Considerations

Boolean masking and `np.where()` operations are highly optimized in NumPy. They:

* Avoid explicit loops in Python
* Execute at C-speed under the hood
* Allow vectorized operations on large datasets

For large datasets, these techniques are drastically faster than traditional iteration.

:::{Keypoints}

* Boolean masking provides an intuitive way to filter arrays based on conditions
* `np.where()` in its single-argument form finds indices where conditions are true
* `np.where(condition, x, y)` acts as a vectorized if-else statement
* `np.isin()` lets us filter based on membership in a set of values
