## Specific Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

1. NumPy Foundations
   * Explain NumPy's purpose and advantages over standard Python lists
   * Describe how NumPy leverages contiguous memory allocation for improved performance

2. Array Creation and Structure
   * Create NumPy arrays of different dimensions from Python lists and other data sources
   * Generate arrays using built-in functions like `arange()`, `zeros()`, `ones()`, and `random.random()`
   * Examine array attributes such as `shape`, `ndim`, `size`, and `dtype`

3. Data Types
   * Contrast Python and NumPy data types for numerical computation
   * Select appropriate NumPy data types for optimizing memory usage and computational precision
   * Understand and manage type coercion in array operations

4. Indexing and Selection
   * Access and manipulate array elements using basic indexing
   * Extract subsets of data using slicing operations in multiple dimensions
   * Apply boolean masking and advanced filtering techniques to arrays

5. Array Operations
   * Reshape and restructure arrays to better match analytical needs
   * Combine arrays using concatenation and splitting operations
   * Generate descriptive statistics using NumPy's built-in functions

6. Vectorization and Performance
   * Implement vectorized operations to replace traditional Python loops
   * Apply broadcasting to perform operations between arrays of different shapes
   * Optimize calculations for working with large biological datasets
