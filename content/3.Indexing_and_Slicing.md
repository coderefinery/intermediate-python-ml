## Introduction

What is Indexing and Slicing?

* Indexing is the process of accessing specific individual elements within a data structure
  * Uses square brackets with a single index value: `array[0]`
  * Most programming languages use zero-based indexing (first element is at position 0)
* Slicing is the process of extracting a subset or range of elements
  * Uses square brackets with a range specification: `array[start:stop:step]`
  * Creates a view of the original data (changes to the slice affect the original array)

Why Indexing Matters in Bioinformatics:

* Bioinformatics deals with large, complex biological datasets:
  * DNA/RNA sequences (can be millions of nucleotides long)
  * Protein sequences
  * Gene expression matrices (thousands of genes Ã— dozens/hundreds of samples)
  * Phylogenetic trees
  * Molecular structures
* Efficient data access is crucial for:
  * Sequence alignment and comparison
  * Identifying motifs or patterns
  * Analyzing specific regions of interest (e.g., genes, domains, binding sites)
  * Processing large-scale genomic or proteomic data
  * Statistical analysis across experimental conditions

## NumPy Arrays in Bioinformatics

* Common bioinformatics applications:
  * Storing sequence data as numeric arrays
  * Representing position weight matrices
  * Managing alignment scores
  * Handling gene expression matrices

## 1D Array Operations

:::{demo}

### 1D Array Indexing

```python
# Example: String sequence converted to numerical representation
# A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3
dna_seq = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 1, 2])  # "ACGTAACG"

# Single element access through indexing
print(dna_seq[0])    # First nucleotide (0 = A)
print(dna_seq[3])    # Fourth nucleotide (3 = T)
print(dna_seq[-1])   # Last nucleotide (2 = G) using negative indexing
```

### 1D Array Slicing

```python
# Slicing * extracting subsequences
print(dna_seq[1:4])  # From second to fourth nucleotide: array([1, 2, 3]) = "CGT"
print(dna_seq[:3])   # First three nucleotides: array([0, 1, 2]) = "ACG"
print(dna_seq[5:])   # From sixth nucleotide to the end: array([0, 1, 2]) = "ACG"

# Slicing with negative indices
print(dna_seq[-3:])  # Last three nucleotides: array([0, 1, 2]) = "ACG"

# Slicing with step
print(dna_seq[::2])  # Every second nucleotide: array([0, 2, 0, 1]) = "AGAC"
```

**Real-world significance in bioinformatics:**

* Indexing:
  * Accessing specific nucleotide positions of interest
  * Retrieving expression values for particular genes
  * Referencing elements in position-specific scoring matrices
  
* Slicing:
  * Extracting specific regions like promoters, exons, or binding sites
  * Identifying sequence motifs (e.g., restriction sites, protein domains)
  * Analyzing k-mers (subsequences of length k)
  * Creating sliding windows along DNA/protein sequences

## 2D Array Operations

:::{demo}

```python
# Example: Gene expression matrix
# Rows = genes, Columns = experimental conditions
gene_expr = np.array([
    [12.5, 10.2, 33.4, 7.8],  # Gene 1 expression across 4 conditions
    [45.1, 43.8, 29.2, 22.1], # Gene 2 expression
    [8.7,  9.2,  12.3, 10.5], # Gene 3 expression
    [67.2, 70.3, 68.7, 71.9]  # Gene 4 expression
])
```

### 2D Array Indexing

```python
# Single element access * specific element at row, column
print(gene_expr[1, 2])    # Expression of Gene 2 in condition 3: 29.2

# Row indexing * accessing specific row
print(gene_expr[0])       # Gene 1 across all conditions: array([12.5, 10.2, 33.4, 7.8])
```

### 2D Array Slicing

```python
# Row slicing * expression profile of one gene across all conditions
print(gene_expr[0, :])    # Gene 1 across all conditions: array([12.5, 10.2, 33.4, 7.8])

# Column slicing * expression of all genes in a specific condition
print(gene_expr[:, 1])    # All genes in condition 2: array([10.2, 43.8, 9.2, 70.3])

# Sub-matrix slicing * subset of genes in subset of conditions
print(gene_expr[0:2, 2:4])
# First 2 genes in conditions 3 and 4:
# array([[33.4,  7.8],
#        [29.2, 22.1]])

# Strided slicing * every other gene, first two conditions

print(gene_expr[::2, :2])
# Genes 1 & 3, conditions 1 & 2:
# array([[12.5, 10.2],
#        [8.7,  9.2]])
```

### Exercise 1: DNA Sequence Analysis (2-3 minutes)

Given a DNA sequence represented as an array of numerical values (A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3):

```python
import numpy as np
dna_seq = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 3])  # "ACGTAACGTTGCAGT"
```

**Tasks:**

1. Extract the first 5 nucleotides
2. Extract the last 4 nucleotides
3. Extract every third nucleotide starting from the first position
4. Extract the subsequence from position 6 to position 10 (inclusive)

:::

:::{solution}

```python
# 1. First 5 nucleotides
print("First 5 nucleotides:", dna_seq[:5])

# 2. Last 4 nucleotides
print("Last 4 nucleotides:", dna_seq[-4:])

# 3. Every third nucleotide
print("Every third nucleotide:", dna_seq[::3])

# 4. Subsequence from position 6 to 10
print("Subsequence pos 6-10:", dna_seq[6:11])
# Note: Upper bound is exclusive in slicing, so we use 11 to include position 10
```

Output

```none
First 5 nucleotides: [0 1 2 3 0]
Last 4 nucleotides: [0 0 2 3]
Every third nucleotide: [0 3 1 3 0 3]

### Exercise 2: Gene Expression Analysis (2-3 minutes)

Given a gene expression matrix where rows represent genes and columns represent conditions:

```python
import numpy as np
gene_expr = np.array([
    [15.2, 21.5, 18.9, 11.8, 25.3],  # Gene 1
    [42.3, 38.1, 29.6, 33.2, 19.7],  # Gene 2
    [8.4,  7.5,  9.2,  8.1,  10.5],  # Gene 3
    [31.6, 29.8, 27.5, 34.9, 36.2],  # Gene 4
    [17.3, 19.8, 22.5, 21.3, 18.2]   # Gene 5
])
```

**Tasks:**

1. Extract the expression values for Gene 3
2. Extract the expression values for all genes under fifth column
3. Extract a sub-matrix containing Genes 2-4 under columns 2-3
4. Find the expression value for Gene 5 under columns 2

**Exercise 2 -Solution:**

```python
# 1. Expression values for Gene 3
print("Gene 3 expression:", gene_expr[2])
# Alternative: gene_expr[2, :]

# 2. Expression values for all genes under column 5
print("Condition 4 expression:", gene_expr[:, 4]) 

# 3. Sub-matrix of Genes 2-4 under columns 2-3
print("Sub-matrix (Genes 2-4, columns 2-3):")
print(gene_expr[1:4, 1:3])
# array([[38.1, 29.6],
#        [7.5,  9.2],
#        [29.8, 27.5]])

# 4. Expression value for Gene 5 under columns 2
print("Gene 5, columns 2:", gene_expr[4, 1]) 
```

Output

```none
Gene 3 expression: [ 8.4  7.5  9.2  8.1 10.5]
Condition 4 expression: [25.3 19.7 10.5 36.2 18.2]
Sub-matrix (Genes 2-4, columns 2-3):
[[38.1 29.6]
 [ 7.5  9.2]
 [29.8 27.5]]
Gene 5, columns 2: 19.8
```


## Exercise 3: Multi-sequence Alignment Analysis (2-3 minutes)

Consider a simplified alignment scoring matrix where each row represents a match (1) or mismatch (0) and each column represents a position in the alignment:

```python
import numpy as np
alignment_scores = np.array([
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],  # Sequence 1
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1],  # Sequence 2
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],  # Sequence 3
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]   # Sequence 4
])  # 1 = match, 0 = mismatch
```

**Tasks:**

1. Find positions where all sequences match (all rows having 1s in a column - use `np.all` with a mask)
2. Extract scores for positions 3-7 for all sequences
3. Find the matching pattern (positions with value 1) for Sequence 3
4. Extract a sub-alignment of the first two sequences for the last five positions

**Exercise 3 -Solution:**


```python
# 1. Positions where all sequences match
all_match = np.all(alignment_scores == 1, axis=0)
print("Positions where all sequences match:", np.where(all_match)[0]) 

# 2. Scores for positions 3-7 for all sequences
print("Positions 3-7 scores:")
print(alignment_scores[:, 3:8])

# 3. Matching pattern for Sequence 3
seq3_matches = alignment_scores[2] == 1
print("Sequence 3 match positions:", np.where(seq3_matches)[0])

# 4. Sub-alignment of first two sequences for last five positions
print("Sub-alignment (Seq 1-2, last 5 positions):")
print(alignment_scores[0:2, 5:])
```

Output

```none
Positions where all sequences match: [3]
Positions 3-7 scores:
[[1 0 1 0 0]
 [1 0 0 1 1]
 [1 1 0 0 1]
 [1 1 1 0 0]]
Sequence 3 match positions: [1 2 3 4 7]
Sub-alignment (Seq 1-2, last 5 positions):
[[1 0 0 1 1]
 [0 1 1 0 1]]
```

## Key Takeaways

:::{Keypoints}

* Efficient indexing and slicing are crucial for bioinformatics workflows
* Key takeaways:
  * Indexing for accessing individual elements
  * Slicing for extracting regions of interest
  * Leverage both for efficient data manipulation in matrices (gene Ã— condition, position Ã— sequence, etc.)
  * Combine with boolean operations for filtering
  * Remember zero-based indexing
* Common pitfalls:
  * Off-by-one errors (especially when converting between biology's 1-based and programming's 0-based systems)
  * Overlooking the exclusive upper bound in slicing (end index is not included)
  * Forgetting that modifying slices can modify the original array (use .copy() when needed)
  * Confusing row-major vs. column-major operations
