## Specific Objectives

* Introduction to Pandas
  * Explain the relationship between Pandas and NumPy, highlighting when to use each library effectively.
  * Define and differentiate between Series and DataFrame data structures in Pandas.
  * Demonstrate the creation of Pandas objects from NumPy arrays, solidifying foundational knowledge.
* Data Import and Export
  * Illustrate how to read data from various formats, including CSV, Excel, and JSON, into Pandas.
  * Show how to export DataFrames to different formats, ensuring participants can save their analyses.
  * Utilize data inspection methods (head, info, describe) to gain an understanding of data structure and content.
* DataFrame Manipulation & Sorting
  * Demonstrate effective techniques for selecting specific rows and from DataFrames.
  * Equip participants with skills to add and remove columns within a DataFrame.
  * Implement sorting methods by values, by index, and perform multiple column sorting with custom orders.
* Indexing, Selection & Slicing
  * Differentiate between label-based and position-based indexing and apply each method appropriately.
  * Use Boolean indexing to filter data based on specific conditions, connecting concepts from NumPy.
  * Apply .loc, .iloc, and .at selection methods to extract desired data, and employ multi-level slicing techniques.
* Handling Missing Data
  * Identify missing values in DataFrames using isna() and notna() methods.
  * Strategize the filling of missing values with fillna() and interpolation methods tailored to scenario needs.
  * Demonstrate how to drop missing data with dropna() and discuss various strategies for handling missing data.
* Merging DataFrames
  * Illustrate how to concatenate DataFrames using pd.concat() and understand its applications.
  * Explain database-style joins with the merge() function and illustrate the different join types (inner, outer, left, * right).
  * Address challenges faced with duplicate columns and indexes during merging operations.
* Summary Statistics & Aggregations
  * Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, min, max) to summarize and analyze data.
  * Develop custom aggregation functions for specific needs in data analysis.
  * Apply GroupBy operations effectively, utilizing the Split-Apply-Combine pattern to derive insights from grouped data.
* Advanced Data Transformation
  * Utilize apply() and map() functions for advanced data transformation on DataFrames.
  * Perform string and datetime operations effectively using Pandas functionality.
  * Construct pivot tables and crosstabs to summarize data visually and contextually.
* Practical Exercises and Q&A
  * Execute practical exercises using real-world datasets to reinforce concepts learned during the workshop.
  * Connect concepts from both NumPy and Pandas to solidify understanding through application.
  * Engage in a Q&A session to clarify doubts, deepen understanding, and discuss challenges faced during practical sessions
